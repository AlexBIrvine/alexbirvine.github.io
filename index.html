            <h2>Damien Reaper: Haunt Icon and Mentor</h2>
            <p>For decades, Damien Reaper has been a mainstay in Cincinnati area haunts. While heâ€™s worked for many, all
                of them have become home and heâ€™s left a lasting legacy wherever he goes as he teaches the new haunt
                blood the ropes.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                <p>"I generally hate people, but Damien Reaper is an exception to this.
                    When I was working in the haunt business, I would always bring a book, a notebook or
                    something else to keep myself occupied and make sure people got the message to move on so I
                    could avoid conversation.
                    Damien Reaper is such a kind, wonderful creature, that I would always put down my book,
                    notebook or whatever manner of social barrier that I had in place to listen to him talk and
                    hear his stories. 10/10 human being."

                <p>"Damien Reaper was a lovely surprise one night when he appeared at Dent to work the rest of
                    the season. He was going to be a clown in a cotton candy room. I've seen his other
                    characters, but I didn't know how this would go. I must say that I enthusiastically want to
                    get some Candy from Mr Reaper and satisfy my sweet tooth over and over again after seeing
                    his performance. 5 out of 5 starts. Highly reccomend....would do again ðŸ˜‰"

                <p>"When someone says "that's a fucking scary motherfucker", the next words they think of
                    usually aren't "kind", "compassionate", or "friendly". But that's the exact experience
                    you'll have knowing Damien Reaper. An absolute pro monster who can bring literal football
                    players to the ground crying in fear, yet genuinely one of the most caring and welcoming
                    people I've ever met in my life who truly cares for everyone around him. 5/5 star haunt
                    friend, cannot be duplicated. you need to know the original."

                <p>"Damien Reaper embodies Halloween 24/7 - not just the spooky, but the giving and ability to
                    put trust in a total stranger to be kind. Meeting Damien at Dungeons of Delhi 23 years ago
                    changed me from a casual lover of all things macabre into a scaring obsessed Halloween
                    machine. Overall, he's a good egg."

                <p>"When I started my first year in the haunted house business, I was akin to a scared puppy who
                    had no idea what he was doing. One night when I was helping with breaks, I got to work with
                    Damien first hand and see how a real professional behaves in the industry. Damien ended up
                    giving me pointers, showing me what to do by example, and genuinely welcoming me into the
                    haunt family. He is a good person as he is spooky."
